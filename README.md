# What is GameBox?

Inspired by the Jackbox Party Pack, GameBox is a free-to-play platform for party video games. Players need not download any software, but can immediately join the action by simply opening up a web browser on a smartphone.

Uses JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, React, and Socket.IO.

Built in ~5 weeks.
